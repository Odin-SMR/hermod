:Abstract: 

        Hermod is a part of the Odin processing chain - automating level1b data
        to level2 data. This document describes the installation, configuration
        and function of the program suite. In short Hermod prepares
        requirements such as external datafiles and launches a Qsmr session
        when all requirements are met.

Level2 processing chain - Hermod
================================

The processing chain program suite is a set of python modules that provides an
information system that makes it possible to track every single Odin Level1
file and choose a suitable processor to make higher level data i.e. Level2
data.
 
Hermod is a part of the Odin processing chain making high level information
from calibrated satelite data to very highlevel data ie. Human understandable
data and possibly data collected and aggragated over longer timeperiods.

Overview
--------

    :height: 5cm

The hermod suite are written mostly in Python_ and small part of the code is
written in C with Python's C-api to extend Pythons capabilities to
interact with different tools in the Processing chain.

Meta data from calculations made by Qsmr is stored in a database and
data is stored in files at the filesystem. 

Hermod is the collection name for the processing chain. The name Hermod was
chosen after one of the sons of Odin - Hermod known for his speed. 

The Hermod processing system can be seen as a set of scripts that glues Qsmr's
calculations and its results into the database. Hermod also uses those result
to find out what data is missing or what can be calculated for the moment ie.
all prerequisits for starting Qsmr calculations are resolved. Hermod also
serves other automated systems like IASCO model with data.

Required dependencies - Installation and configuration
======================================================

The Odin processing chain and Hermo make use of third party software.
They are all based on some type of open source license like GNU GPL or BSD
license.

Hermod is buildt to run on Ubuntu Linux 10.04 (server version) but may work on different Ubuntu versions aswell as other POSIX OS:es probably even on windows.

Hermod needs other components to work properly:

Python_ :

        Hermods core is implemented in Python 2.6. But other version may work.

MySQL_ :

        Relational database to manage metadata. Database installation for this
        project i discussed in `Installation of the Database`_

Torque_ :

        Torque is a Cluster Resource Manager.  Documentation and detailed
        installation instructions can be found at Torque_ documentation pages.
        Site specific configuration will be discussed in `Torque
        configuration`_ section.

Maui_ :
        
        The Cluster Scheduler only site specific setup vill be noted in `Maui
        configuration`_

Other tools :
        
        GCC have to bee installed to be able to compile all python modules.

Installation of the Database
-----------------------------
 
Configuration of database is minimal. Standard apt installation of the package mysql-server is enough see `Appendix A - MySQL create script`_ and `Appendix B - MySQL Table layout`_ for database and table layout.

Torque configuration
--------------------
 
Two types of Torque installations are required - one server installation and
several client installations on each node in the cluster. The server
installation manages the queueingsystem and needs to know about all clients
(computee nodes) in the cluster. The clients does only need to now about the
server.

 
Torque client configuration
___________________________
 
A site-specific installation script ``/misc/apps/torque-package-mom-linux-x86_64.sh`` provided all configuration needed at the client.

This is probably a lie - but would be nice to regenerate the scripts to include everything...

Torque server configuration
___________________________
 
A site-specific installation script ``torque-package-server-linux-x86_64.sh`` installs binaries and libraries and some basic configuration. Configuration to reflect connected nodes and their capabilities is necesary.

The file ``/var/spool/torque/server_priv/nodes`` defines the computee nodes:

        glass np=8 hermod node x86_64
        sard np=2 hermod node x86_64 

The attributes hermod, node and x86_64 specifies different capabilities en each node. 'x86_64' tells us the architechture on the node is 64 bits. 'hermod' states that hermod, Qsmr and Q-pack in installed and works correctly. The last attribute shows us the computer is a node with no other users than the torque queue operates the computer. 'desktop' would state it is a workstation with human users.

Some additional settings con be done through torque's configuration program ``qmgr``. A printout of Torque server settings generated with ``qmgr -C 'print server'`` can be found in `Appendix C - Torque server settings`_.

 
Maui configuration
------------------
 
The main configuration file can be found at ``morion.rss.chalmers.se``.
 
         /usr/local/maui/maui.cfg
 
         
Full configuration file can be found in `Appendix D - Maui configuration`_.

Overview
--------

.. JUNO is a program suite written in Python that interacts with AMATERASU and the
.. SMILES DATABASE. JUNO runs regulary and decides when to run AMATERASU according
.. to information JUNO can find in the SMILES DATABASE. JUNO provides a fully
.. automatic processing system for processing data from LEVEL1 to LEVEL2.

Package details
---------------

.. JUNO is divided into several smaller enteties that provide specific functionality.
.. 
.. juno.hdf5
.. 
.. The juno.hdf5 package aggregates AMATERASU LEVEL2 data in to a HDF5 file
.. containing all data from a specific day and species. Normally this program runs
.. from a crontab (launched on a specific time each day) but it runs easily from the command line.
.. 
.. Log in as ``smiles`` on ``smiles-p10``. The command ``hdfwriter`` will find level1 scans and put the in the queue to process level2 data. Output will be placed in ``/mnt/raid0/smilesdata/level2r``.
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
.. 
..         smiles@smiles-p10:/mnt/raid0/smilesdata/juno$ bin/hdf5writer -h
..         
..         Usage: hdf5writer [options]
..         
..         Aggregates Level2_nict profiles to a HDF EOS file.
..         
..         Options:

.. 
.. juno.pbs
.. 
.. This package interfaces with the resource manager TORQUE to put AMATERASU jobs into the batch queue.
.. 
.. Log in as smiles on ``smiles-p1``. The command ``launchjobs`` will find level1 scans and put the in the queue to process level2 data.

.. 
..         junosavemat -f output.mat l1bfile.l1b

HERMOD Installation
-------------------

.. The main installation is located in the ``/mnt/raid0/smilesdata/juno``
.. directory.  From this location all processing nodes runs their instances of
.. JUNO from.  Unfortunately due to different Ubuntu versions installed throught
.. out the computing system smiles-p1 is not using the same directory to run from.
.. This due to different libraries install on different version of ubuntu.
.. Programs running on smiles-p1 runs from ``/home/smiles/python/smiles``
.. 
.. Installing on ubuntu 9.10 requires the following packages.
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
.. 
..         pyton-dev
..         python-virtualenv
..         python-setuptools
..         subversion
..         libhdf5-serial-dev
..         libatlas-base-dev
..         gfortran
..         libfreetype6-dev
..         libpng12-dev
..         python-wxgtk2.8
..         python-gtk2-dev
..         libmysqlclient-dev
..         libwxgtk2.8-dev
.. 
.. To test if all libraries are available on a machine run the following line. This command generates no output if everything is ok:
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
.. 
..         find /mnt/raid0/smilesdata/juno/ -regex .*so -exec ldd \{\} + | grep \
..                 "not found" | sort -u
.. 
.. 
.. To make sure our environment does not change and break when the ubuntu system
.. updates. Juno is installed in a virtual environment. This is done with the
.. ubuntu apt package ``virtual-env``. All packages ready for deployment is put in
.. ``/mnt/raid0/smilesdata/distributionfiles`` by the JUNO developers
.. 
.. First time installation:
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
..         
..         $ virtual-env -p/usr/bin/python2.6 --no-site-packages dir_to_install
..         $ cd dir_to_install
..         $ easy_install --find-links=/mnt/raid0/smilesdata/distributionfiles\
..                  junomain
.. 
.. This will pull a complete installation of latest available JUNO, AMATERASU and dependencies.

Developers installation
_______________________

.. An automatic script to install a developers environment exists. The script will
.. work in Smiles computing environment - on the smiles-pn  machines. Download it
.. an run it:
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
.. 
..         $ wget http://svn.rss.chalmers.se/svn/smiles//trunk/create_virtualenv.sh
..         $ sh create_virtualenv.sh dir_to_install
.. 
.. This script creates a virtual environment and downloads all source code from
.. the svn server. By running the ``build-all``-script a semi-automated deployment starts building all packages and proposes commands to run for deployment
.. of the JUNO packages in the computing environment.
.. 
.. .. code-block:: none
..         
..         $ dir_to_install/dist_all 
.. 
.. Both script is provided in `Appendix E - Juno scripts` for reference.

The source of  hermod is available at `Chalmers' Subversion repoitory`__ .

.. _svn: http://svn.rss.chalmers.se/svn/odinsmr/hermod

__ svn_

Datamodel
---------

The database consists of a number of loosly connected tables with records
(rows) describing meta data about satelite measurement or file stored on disk.

The Hermod data model is pretty simple. All tables are 'nitted' together with a
'id' field. For example in the 'level1'-table the logical key that identifies
each row is the fields 'orbit','calversion' and 'freqmode'.

level1:
        
        id -> orbit, calversion, freqmode -> 'records in level1'

The 'id'-field is included in the 'level2'-table to make it possible to find all level2 products derived from a 'level1' record.

level2:
        
        id, fqid, scanno -> 'records in level2-table'

level2files:
        
        id, fqid -> 'records in level2files-table'


Finding scans available for processing
______________________________________

.. When a scan with the corresponding GEOS5 information is available the scan can
.. be selected for execution (launched to execution queue). There are some
.. constraints â if a level2 file already exists or level2 file already is queued
.. or previous execution ended with an error.
.. 
.. The following query describes it more precisely:
.. 
.. .. code-block:: mysql
.. 
..         SELECT L1b_filename, GEOS5_LEVEL1_filename, date, scan,
..             L1b_version, L1b_type from LEVEL1 
..             natural join GEOS5_LEVEL1
..             natural left join LEVEL2_chain l2
..             where L2_flag=0  and l2.status is Null
..             and GEOS5_flag=1

Queuing and execution
_____________________

.. A "job" is defined from the lookup in the previous section. And information
.. about the processing is sent to a queue for later execution. The Resource
.. system that handles the queue and the execution nodes in the computing cluster
.. (``smiles-p3``, ``smiles-p4``, ``smiles-p5,...``) is Torque_. 
.. Basically the "job" is a shell script sent to another machine for execution.
.. 
.. The script ``launchjobs`` described in juno.pbs_ puts  the script ``junorunner`` in queue with different input parameters to  run on the computee nodes.

Processing
__________

The ``hermodprocessor``-script executes the main-function in
``odin.hermod.processor``-module. This module looks in the database to find
level1b records which not have as many corresponding level2 records as hermod
expects.

When Hermod detects a job to run - Hermod sends a wrapped Qsmr job to the
processing cluser and collects the results and puts them in the dabase and the
filesystem.
